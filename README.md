Video For The Web
ITP - Summer Session II 2013
Tues & Thurs 6:30 - 9:25pm

Instructor: Craig Protzel craig.protzel@nyu.edu
Office Hours: Wednesdays 3-6pm

Description: Whether shot on a smartphone and pieced together using a $.99 app or filmed on a Canon 5D DSLR and meticulously arranged using high-end editing software, video of all shapes and sizes exist throughout the web. Given the accessibility of tools, how do we create video that is non-linear yet compelling, interactive yet engaging? The goal of this class is to introduce students to the fundamentals of video production and storytelling in the context of short form content intended for the web. Specific genres covered will include trailers, promos, educational videos, documentaries, journalistic pieces, and web series. In the first three weeks of the class, students will learn the basics of both audio and video recording using a variety of cameras and audio recorders. Specific topics covered will include scripts and storyboards, camera usage, editing, lighting, and sound. Students will develop, produce, and finish 3 separate short form pieces of content based on conceptual prompts and technical constraints. The second half of the class will focus specifically on interactive applications of video on the web. A variety of use cases will be covered and students will be encouraged to concept and develop their own final web-based video project. Some web development will be covered but this is not a web development course. Each week, a guest speaker from companies/organizations including HBO, Vimeo, and the Boston Globe will join us to share first-hand industry experiences. Overall course work will include reading assignments and 4 short-form video projects. No prior technical skills are required.
