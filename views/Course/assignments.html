		<div class="listInfo">Create a :90 “Kickstarter-esque” video focused on an “NYC CitiBike-Inspired Venture”. You must come up with an idea that will “improve” the <a class="classLink" target="blank" href="http://citibikenyc.com/">CITIBIKE</a> experience by solving a “problem” the new program poses. This could be a physical product, a service, a store, an app, anything - it just has to relate to the new program. Your video is meant to live on a Kickstarter page where you are raising money for this venture. You must include AT LEAST one interview shot, one shot of a CitiBike, and one shot of your “idea”. The “idea” shot could be a drawing, a fake-prototype, a photo, a re-enactment - just need some visual representation of what you are trying to fund. The piece must also include “backer-rewards.” Here is a link to the actual <a class="classLink" target="blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/school">KICKSTARTER VIDEO HELP PAGE</a> for some helpful tips. Be creative and have fun with this.

		<div class="listInfoBold">Assignment #1 - "A Story About You"</div>
		<div class="listInfo">Create a 1-3 min single shot video telling us a story about yourself. Use only a smartphone camera (if you don't have a smartphone camera, feel free to use any camera at your disposal, whatever's easiest). Shoot it in a single shot, NO EDITING. You are allowed to narrate the video but you are NOT ALLOWED TO BE IN IT. Title your video and upload it online. Be prepared to present and discuss your video in class.
